Introduction
The end of this course is near, and by now, you have learned a lot of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and it is time you apply all this knowledge together in your first programming project! 

A DOM manipulation project. If you choose this approach, the webpage must:

Have a minimum of 2 HTML pages.
Have content and styles.
Include separate HTML and CSS files.
You can choose any topic you like (movies, shows, a portfolio, a series of books, etc.).
Your webpage must include three different interactions using DOM manipulation with three different event listeners. For instance: a button that allows the user to write their name in a prompt and then prints it on the webpage as a way of personalization, buttons to make elements show and hide, buttons to make color or image changes, etc.
Nice to have: responsive behavior.
